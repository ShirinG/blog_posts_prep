1. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has called on Argentina to adopt measures to address the quality of official GDP and consumer price index data, and issued an updated statement on Argentina’s progress on August 31, 2016: http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2016/08/31/PR16389-Statement-by-the-IMF-Executive-Board-on-Argentina. 

2. The World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness of official exchange rates as conversion factors. An alternative conversion factor is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate effectively applied to domestic transactions of foreign currencies and traded products. In the case of Argentina, the World Bank has found that during 2012-2015 there were two exchange rates (official and parallel) and parallel exchange rate (blue chip swap rate) was used in around 20% of the transactions.
