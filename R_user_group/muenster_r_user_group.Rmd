Code for the logo, which of course has been created in R:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggmap)
library(ggthemes)

munster <- get_map(location = 'Munster', zoom = 12, maptype = "watercolor")
ggmap(munster) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(51.94, 51.97)) +
  annotate("text", x=7.565, y=51.96, label= "MünsteR", size = 8) +
  annotate("text", x=7.685, y=51.945, label= "R Users Group", size = 5) +
  theme_map()
ggsave("r_user_group_logo.pdf")
```
